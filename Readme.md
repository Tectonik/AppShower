# AppShower

## Description
> AppShower is an idea development project(not to be confused with crowdfunding) that aims to make theorized projects into reality! The aim here is to create a platform to post one's project, and possibly have it greenlit. The idea is that once a project gets posted, rather than receiving *money*, it can receive *offers*, which the owners can the accept or decline. The concept of an offer is quite simple: Say we have a project about new ways of creating chocolate. Once initialized, the project is allotted a month in  which it can be viewed by companies and users alike. Now let's suppose Ferrero has developed an interest in the project. Once Ferrero has decided that it wants to, it can send an offer. The offer consists of several elements: An initial budget, further development concepts and implementation, a business plan, conditions, creative environment, initial start-completion dates and many more. The projects owners can then decide if they want to accept or decline the offer. If the offer is accepted, the project is removed from the list of active projects and all further development of the idea is handled by the two partners. If the offer was, instead, declined, business continues as usual for the project until a new offer has been received or the project is taken down for one reason or another.
